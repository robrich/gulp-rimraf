gulp-rimraf ![status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/robrich/gulp-rimraf.png?branch=master)
===========

Deprecated in favor of [https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/delete-files-folder.md](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/delete-files-folder.md)

[rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf) plugin for [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)

Usage
-----

 1. Delete a folder: use [rimraf](https://github.com/isaacs/rimraf) directly *(you don't need gulp-rimraf!)*:

 ```javascript
 var rimraf = require('gulp-rimraf'); // rimraf directly
 gulp.task('task', function (cb) {
	rimraf('./folder', cb);
 });
 ```

 2. Delete some files in a folder: use gulp-rimraf

 ```javascript
 var ignore = require('gulp-ignore');
 var rimraf = require('gulp-rimraf');

 gulp.task('task', function() {
  return gulp.src('./**/*.js', { read: false }) // much faster
    .pipe(ignore('node_modules/**'))
    .pipe(rimraf());
 });
 ```
 Setting option `read` to false prevents gulp to read the contents of the files and makes this task much faster.

 Files and folders outside the current working directory can be removed with `force` option.

 ```javascript
 var rimraf = require('gulp-rimraf');

 gulp.task('task', function() {
  return gulp.src('../temp/*.js', { read: false })
    .pipe(rimraf({ force: true }));
 });
```
